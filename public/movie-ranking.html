<h1>Karen's Movie Ranking</h1>
<h2>Movies I enjoyed at some point</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Pride and Predjudice</h3>
<p>It's an epoque movie, with romance and drama. It's about characters' growth.</p>
<h3>Breakfast at Tiffany's</h3>
<p>It's about finding yourself but in a unique way. Might include romance.</p>
<h3>Star Wars Episode III</h3>
<p>I was severely broken hearted after watching the Clone Wars. But still, i recommend it.</p>
